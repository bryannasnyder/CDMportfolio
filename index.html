    <h1>Bryanna Snyder</h1>
    <p>I have lived in Pittsburgh for 14 years, but was born and raised in California. I am an experienced administrator, travel enthusiast, and an undergraduate student in the University of Pittsburgh’s Media and Professional Communication’s program specializing in Corporate and Community Relations.
      My goal is to use the skills I have learned in digital media and professional communication from my degree and transition into a career where I can create stories through design.

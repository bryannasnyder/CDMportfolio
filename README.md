# CDMportfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! 
I am building a website to showcase my work and demonstrate the skills Iâ€™ve learned while earning my degree at Pitt. 
The portfolio highlights my skills in a variety of media. My target audience would be potential employers and colleagues. 
I would also like to list my portfolio on social media and my resume so that people are able to access examples of my work. 
While interacting with my site, I want people to find it usable, clean, and simple. I'm an organized person who enjoys life and I hope to express that through my page. 
People should also see that I have broad interests and enjoy designing.
